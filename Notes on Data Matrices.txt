Note:
Each row represents the data that are partitioned into the cluster indicated by the row index
The value in each column represents how many data exist / are predicted in that specific column category
Each column category is pre-defined to represent different classes:
For Size: [Small, Medium, Large]
For color: [Blue, Yellow, Green, Red, Pink]
For Shape: [Ball, Square, Star]
Programs are written to compare the cluster indices for accuracy reporting
So the ground truth is also converted to its corresponding cluster for comparison
