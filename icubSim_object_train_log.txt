To set up a white huge wall for background:

command:

world mk sbox 8 8 2 0 3 3 255 255 255

This creates a static cube with 8 and 8 units of length in x and y direction and 2 units in z direction (depth) (x, y, z are in the world frame; different than those from robot's frame)

world mk sbox [x, y, z (dimension of the new object)] [x, y, z (position in the world frame)] [R G B value]

# My plan and goal:
have 45 training data
have the rest as testing data
first just create as many variation as possible
training:
2 images per combination
I have:
3 shapes
5 colors
3 sizes
--> 45 unique combinations
--> need at least 5 data to cover all cases
